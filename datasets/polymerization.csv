"p-hydroxystyrene","{'Separately, a polyethylene film having a thickness of 0.1 mm was inserted into a glass ampoule, and subsequently, a tetrahydrofuran-n-heptane mixed solution (1:2 by volume) containing 20 wt% of p-acetoxystyrene monomer was added thereto, followed by heat-sealing the glass ampoule in vacuum. After irradiation of γ-rays of 105 rad/hr at a temperature of 25° C for 10 hours, the resulting film was taken out of the glass ampoule and sufficiently washed with acetone to remove the p-acetoxystyrene homopolymer. The thus treated film was then refluxed in a concentrated hydrochloric acid-methanol mixed solution (1:4 by volume) under heating for a period of 30 minutes, followed by hydrolysis to obtain a film in which a p-hydroxystyrene side chain was grafted at a grafting ratio of 52 wt% (based on the polyethylene). This film was further immersed in concentrated sulfuric acid at a temperature of 25° C for 72 hours and then sulfonated to obtain a cationic exchange membrane. The thus obtained cationic exchange membrane was used as a diaphragm. To the cationic exchange membrane to be used as a diaphragm was subjected a pre-treatment in which the membrane was immersed in a 0.5N sodium hydroxide aqueous solution at a temperature of 80° C for a period of 2 hours prior to the electrolysis. This cationic exchange membrane had a cation transport number of 0.97, an electric resistance, in 0.5N sodium chloride, of 1.7 Ω-cm2, and an acidic ion-exchange capacity of 2.2 meq/g. A current of 1.0 A (10 A/dm2) was passed for 5 hours. It was found that the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the catholyte was 16.8& by weight, that the concentration of sodium chloride was 0.02% by weight, and that the current efficiency was 83%.'}","C([O:4][C:5]1[CH:12]=[CH:11][C:8]([CH:9]=[CH2:10])=[CH:7][CH:6]=1)(=O)C>O1CCCC1.CCCCCCC>[OH:4][C:5]1[CH:12]=[CH:11][C:8]([CH:9]=[CH2:10])=[CH:7][CH:6]=1 ","[OH][C]1[CH]=[CH][C]([CH]=[CH2])=[CH][CH]=1"
"hexamethylene sebacate","{'Crystalline poly (hexamethylene sebacate) was prepared using a kettle equipped with a stirrer, nitrogen gas inlet tube, thermometer and condenser by reacting sebacic acid with 1,6hexamethylene glycol in the presence of a p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst as follows: sebacic acid and hexamethylene glycol were added to the reaction kettle in a respective 1.0 to 1.1 molar ratio along with 0.5 wt % p-toluenesulfonic acid. The 10 mole % excess of glycol was used to ensure the predominant presence of hydroxyl end groups in the reaction product. The mixture was heated to 165°C while stirring. At 165°C, an amount of xylene was added to assist refluxing and this temperature was maintained until water evolution ceased (4 hrs.). Afterwards, the condensers were removed and the excess glycol and catalyst were removed by sparging with nitrogen for 0.5 hours at 165°C. On cooling to room temperature, the poly (hexamethylene sebacate) crystallized into an off-white solid. Next, the poly (HMS) from above was purified by precipitation from a benzene solution into methanol using techniques well known in the art. The precipitated poly (HMS) was collected by filtration and dried in vacuo. Analytical data on this purified material indicate an acid number of 1.06, an hydroxyl number of 34.4, an Mn of 3165 g/mole, an MWD (Mw /Mn) of 1.41 by GPC in chloroform, a glass transition temperature of about -62°C and a crystalline melting point of about 65°C.'}","[C:1]([OH:14])(=[O:13])[CH2:2][CH2:3][CH2:4][CH2:5][CH2:6][CH2:7][CH2:8][CH2:9][C:10]([OH:12])=[O:11].[CH2:15](O)[CH2:16][CH2:17][CH2:18][CH2:19][CH2:20]O.C1(C)C=CC(S(O)(=O)=O)=CC=1.C1(C)C(C)=CC=CC=1>C1(C)C=CC(S(O)(=O)=O)=CC=1.O>[C:1]1(=[O:14])[O:13][CH2:20][CH2:19][CH2:18][CH2:17][CH2:16][CH2:15][O:12][C:10](=[O:11])[CH2:9][CH2:8][CH2:7][CH2:6][CH2:5][CH2:4][CH2:3][CH2:2]1","[C]1(=[O])[O][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][O][C](=[O])[CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2][CH2]1"
"styrene","{'A copolymer of styrene and isoprene was prepared by polymerization of a mixture of the two monomers in cyclohexane solution, resulting in a tapered copolymer having 37.5 wt.% styrene. The polymer, in cyclohexane solvent, was then subjected to hydrogenation utilizng a catalyst comprising the reaction product of 2.5 moles of aluminum triethyl per mole of nickel-2-ethylhexoate. The hydrogenation reacton conditions comprised 700 psig hydrogen pressure, 80°C, 18% polymer solids in the solution and 4.0 mmoles nickel per pound of polymer. After 180 minutes hydrogenation time, 93.5% of the olefinic unsaturation had been reduced. At this point, triethyl aluminum (TEA) was added, causing substantially complete interruption of hydrogenation. This was indicated by the fact that after holding for 30 additional minutes, the percent of hydrogenation of olefinic bonds had only increased about 1%. In a parallel run with no supplemental TEA being added, the percentage of olefin reduction is about 97.3% after a total of 210 minutes hydrogenation under the same conditions. In the process according to the invention as described above, one mole of supplemental TEA was added per mole of nickel.'}","[CH2:1]=[CH:2][C:3]1[CH:8]=[CH:7][CH:6]=[CH:5][CH:4]=1.[H][H].C([Al](CC)CC)C>C1CCCCC1.[Ni]>[CH2:1]=[CH:2][C:3]1[CH:8]=[CH:7][CH:6]=[CH:5][CH:4]=1.[CH2:1]=[CH:2][C:3](=[CH2:4])[CH3:8]","[CH2]=[CH][C]1[CH]=[CH][CH]=[CH][CH]=1.[CH2]=[CH][C](=[CH2])[CH3]"
